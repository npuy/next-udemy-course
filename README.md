# Next.js: The React Framework for Production

This repository is dedicated to uploading practical assignments and exercises from the course **Next.js: The React Framework for Production**.

Here you will find all the projects, code samples, and solutions developed throughout the course. The main goal is to keep track of my own progress and store my work while I complete the course.

Feel free to explore the content, but it's mainly for personal use.
